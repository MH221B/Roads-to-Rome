# Teamwork Report - Roads to Rome

## Team Structure

Our team consists of **3 members** working collaboratively on the Roads to Rome project. Each team member brings diverse skills and perspectives to contribute to the full-stack development of this web application.

## Communication Strategy

### Primary Communication Channel: Messenger

We utilize **Facebook Messenger** as our primary communication platform for:

- **Daily updates**: Team members share progress, blockers, and achievements
- **Quick coordination**: Rapid decisions and problem-solving discussions
- **Information sharing**: Sharing resources, documentation, and helpful links
- **Flexibility**: Asynchronous communication that allows team members to respond at their own pace

This approach provides a more flexible alternative to formal daily standups while maintaining constant team awareness and engagement.

## Sprint Structure

### Weekly Sprints

Each week is organized as a **1-week sprint**, providing:

- **Regular planning cycles**: Weekly rhythms align with course schedules and project milestones
- **Achievable goals**: Shorter sprints allow for focused, realistic task planning
- **Faster feedback loops**: Weekly reviews enable quick iteration and course correction
- **Momentum maintenance**: Continuous progress tracking keeps team motivation high

## Task Management & Distribution

### AI-Assisted Task Splitting

To ensure **fair and equal work distribution** among team members, we leverage AI tools to:

- **Break down large features** into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Estimate complexity** and effort for each task consistently
- **Balance workload**: AI analysis helps identify tasks of similar size and difficulty
- **Ensure equity**: Prevents any single team member from being overloaded

### Unbiased Task Assignment: Wheel of Fortune

To guarantee **fair and impartial task allocation**, we use the **Wheel of Fortune** method:

- **Random selection**: Tasks are randomly assigned to team members
- **Eliminates bias**: Removes personal preferences or subjective decision-making
- **Equal opportunity**: Each member has an equal chance of receiving any task
- **Transparency**: Random assignment is visible to all team members, building trust

### Task Tracking & Documentation: Notion

Assigned tasks and critical project information are centralized in **Notion**, serving as a single source of truth:

- **Weekly task board**: All tasks assigned to team members are documented and organized by week
- **Clear visibility**: Team members can easily look up their assigned tasks and understand weekly objectives
- **Task details**: Each task includes descriptions, subtasks, and relevant links for reference
- **Environment management**: Latest environment variables and configuration values are stored and maintained in Notion
- **Shared knowledge base**: Centralized documentation reduces confusion and ensures everyone has access to critical information

## Workflow Summary

1. **Task Creation**: Large features are identified and split into smaller tasks using AI assistance
2. **Work Distribution**: Tasks are randomly assigned using Wheel of Fortune
3. **Documentation**: Assigned tasks are stored in Notion with all relevant details and weekly organization
4. **Sprint Execution**: Team members reference Notion to understand their weekly tasks and environment configurations
5. **Daily Communication**: Progress and challenges are shared via Messenger
6. **Weekly Review**: Team reflects on the sprint, discusses learnings, and plans the next week

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Fairness**: AI + randomization ensures no one bears disproportionate workload
- **Flexibility**: Messenger-based updates are less rigid than scheduled meetings
- **Transparency**: Clear task assignments and random selection build team trust
- **Continuous Improvement**: Weekly cycles enable rapid adjustments to process
- **Skill Development**: Task rotation exposes team members to diverse parts of the codebase
- **Collaboration**: Regular communication maintains strong team cohesion

## Conclusion

By combining AI-powered task analysis with random assignment and flexible communication, we've created a teamwork framework that prioritizes fairness, clarity, and efficient delivery. Our weekly sprint structure with Messenger-based daily updates provides the right balance between structure and flexibility for our agile development process.
